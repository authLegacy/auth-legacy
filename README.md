- **Project Name and Tagline:** AuthLegacy; Every item tells a story.
- **Problem Statement:** Physical goods often lack a reliable, tamper-proof system to verify authenticity and maintain ownership records, leading to lost provenance and reduced value over time. Industries face increasing pressure to comply with regulations like the EU’s Digital Product Passport, demanding transparency and detailed lifecycle data. The absence of robust traceability hinders resale, reuse, and sustainable practices, contributing to waste and stalling the development of circular economies. Existing authentication methods are costly, inefficient, and unprepared to support the needs of future generations.
- **Solution:** The solution lies in creating a blockchain-based infrastructure that provides tamper-proof digital records for physical goods, ensuring authenticity, ownership, and lifecycle data are preserved immutably. By leveraging decentralized attestation networks, the system allows experts to validate items, embedding their provenance in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) tied to the items themselves. This infrastructure enables compliance with regulations like the EU’s Digital Product Passport, supports circular economy practices by facilitating reuse and recycling, and fosters transparency across supply chains. Designed for scalability, it prepares industries and individuals for a future where every physical item tells its story, empowering informed decisions, ethical sourcing, and sustainable consumption.
- **Key Features:**
    - Decentralized Authentication: Expert attestors validate items from various sectors, ensuring unbiased and professional verification with at least two attestors per item.
    - NFT-Based Provenance: Items are minted as NFTs upon upload, embedding authenticity, ownership, and lifecycle history immutably on-chain.
    - Role-Specific Functionality: Sellers upload product details for authentication, attestors validate items and earn incentives, and buyers purchase authenticated goods with NFT-backed proof of authenticity.
    - Transparent Marketplace: Items are listed for sale only after successful authentication, ensuring trust and confidence for all users.
    - Storytelling and Resale Support: NFTs preserve each item’s history, promoting reuse, higher resale value, and reduced waste.
    - Regulatory Compliance: Aligns with standards like the EU’s Digital Product Passport, supporting traceability and sustainability.
    - Scalability and Future-Readiness: Designed for diverse use cases, including ethical sourcing, supply chain transparency, and circular economy practices.
